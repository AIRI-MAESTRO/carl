Example: LLM Council — Multiple Models Voting on a Decision.

This example demonstrates how to use different LLM models within a single
CARL chain to implement a "council" pattern where multiple models independently
analyze a problem and then vote on the best decision.

Pattern overview:
    1. Multiple LLM steps run IN PARALLEL, each using a different model
       (via per-step LLMStepConfig overrides)
    2. A TOOL step aggregates the votes from all council members
    3. A final LLM step synthesizes the council's reasoning into a verdict

This is useful for:
    - Reducing bias from a single model
    - Getting diverse perspectives on complex decisions
    - Increasing confidence in critical choices
    - Leveraging different model strengths (cost vs quality vs speed)

Prerequisites:
    pip install 'mmar-carl[openai]'
    # or: pip install openai

Environment variables:
    OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenRouter API key (https://openrouter.ai)

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."

DECISION_SCENARIO = """
Technology Stack Decision for a New Fintech Startup:

Context:
- Building a real-time payment processing platform
- Expected to handle 10,000 transactions per second at peak
- Team of 8 engineers (5 backend, 2 frontend, 1 DevOps)
- Must comply with PCI DSS and SOC 2 requirements
- MVP needed in 4 months, full launch in 8 months
- Budget: $500K for first year infrastructure

Options under consideration:

Option A: Go + PostgreSQL + Kubernetes
- Pros: High performance, strong concurrency, growing ecosystem
- Cons: Smaller talent pool, less mature ORM tooling

Option B: Java/Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Kubernetes
- Pros: Battle-tested in fintech, vast ecosystem, strong typing
- Cons: Verbose, slower development speed, higher memory usage

Option C: Node.js/TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Kubernetes
- Pros: Full-stack JS, fast prototyping, large talent pool
- Cons: Single-threaded (needs clustering), less suitable for CPU-heavy tasks

Please evaluate each option and vote for the best choice.
